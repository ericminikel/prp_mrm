This repository holds the code and data for a manuscript in progress:

Minikel & Kuhn et al, Domain-specific quantification of PrP in cerebrospinal fluid by targeted mass spectrometry. In preparation.

In this manuscript we describe prion protein (PrP) multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) &mdash; a targeted mass spec assay &mdash; and what we learned from applying this assay to clinical samples of cerebrospinal fluid from prion disease and non-prion disease patients.

In this repository you can:

+ View the [data as exported from Skyline](/data/skyline/), the [data after processing in R](/data/processed/), and the [script that does the processing](/src/process_data.R).
+ Download a [summary table of the MRM data for clinical samples](/data/summary/clinical_sample_mrm_results.tsv).
+ Reproduce display items and statistics from the manuscript by running [src/mrm_figures.R](src/mrm_figures.R). This will write Figures 2, 3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, and Tables 1, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7 to the [display_items/script_generated/](display_items/script_generated/) directory. Editable versions of display items created manually in PowerPoint or Excel are provided in [display_items/manual/](display_items/manual/).
