[Full text](https://www.mcponline.org/content/18/12/2388).

In this manuscript we describe prion protein (PrP) multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) &mdash; a targeted mass spec assay &mdash; and what we learned from applying this assay to clinical samples of cerebrospinal fluid from prion disease and non-prion disease patients.

In this repository you can:

+ View the [data as exported from Skyline](/data/skyline/), the [data after processing in R](/data/processed/), and the [script that does the processing](/src/process_data.R).
+ Download a [summary table of the MRM data for clinical samples](/data/summary/clinical_sample_mrm_results.tsv) and a [summary of the pilot LC-MS/MS DDA data](https://github.com/ericminikel/prp_mrm/blob/master/data/dda/csf_dda_sumbyintensity_190331.tsv).
+ Reproduce display items and statistics from the manuscript by running [src/mrm_figures.R](src/mrm_figures.R). This will write several figures and tables to the [display_items/script_generated/](display_items/script_generated/) directory; editable versions of display items created manually in PowerPoint or Excel are provided in [display_items/manual/](display_items/manual/).
